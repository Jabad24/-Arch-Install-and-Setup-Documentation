# -Arch-Install-and-Setup-Documentation
#The first thing I did was read the Arch Wiki. I installed and downloaded the archlinux-2025.11.01-x86_64.iso file, uploaded it, and created my virtual machine. I ran into a problem right from the start. I didn't set enough memory, so I had to restart my VM right away. I changed the settings, and after getting the internet connection, I started installation. I got to disk formatting and setup; I partitioned and formatted the disk and mounted it—the installation process allowed for the package installation for the new system. I configured my timezone with timedatectl set-timezone America/New_York and created an administrator user with my name passwd useradd -m -G wheel josue passwd josue Then I did the same for Codi's username. From there, I could start installing the GUI packages. I encountered some issues where some of the packages didn't install completely, but I was able to reinstall them and finish the installation. I also added in 6 aliases out of the 6 two of them was alias ll='ls -lh', and alias la='ls -A'. Ll creates the files into a readable size and la list all files including hidden ones.
